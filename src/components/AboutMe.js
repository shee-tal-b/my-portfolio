        <p>
          I am currently a fourth year college student studying in Bengaluru. I am fascinated
          by the potential of AI to solve complex problems and eager to explore areas
          like machine learning and data analytics. My goal is to build a strong foundation in AI and 
          Data Science through hands-on projects and internships. I am excited to learn and contribute
          to innovative solutions.
